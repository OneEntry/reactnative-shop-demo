# Authorization Documentation

Authorization is a critical component of the system. Without it, many features are inaccessible because they require a **JWT session token**.

---

## How It Works

1. **JWT Tokens**
    - **`accessToken`**:
        - Used for API requests.
        - Short-lived and frequently refreshed.
    - **`refreshToken`**:
        - Stored securely (e.g., in `AsyncStorage`).
        - Changes every 30 days or upon re-authentication.

2. **SDK Handles Tokens**
    - Most token management is handled by the **OneEntry SDK**.
    - You only need to pass the `refreshToken` during SDK initialization:
      ```typescript
      defineOneEntry({ token: '123' });
      ```

## [AuthContext]

All authorization logic, including login and registration, is located in the **[AuthContext]**. This is a React context that centralizes authentication workflows.

- **Usage**:
    - The `AuthContext` wraps the entire application in `App.tsx`:
      ```tsx
      <AuthContext.Provider value={authValue}>
        <App />
      </AuthContext.Provider>
      ```
    - Components outside the context cannot use its features.
